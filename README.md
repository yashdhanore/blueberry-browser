## Overview

You are the **CTO of Blueberry Browser**, a Strawberry competitor. Your mission is to add a feature to Blueberry that makes it superior & more promising than Strawberry.

But your time is limited—Strawberry is about to raise a two billion dollar Series A round from X-Separator, B17Å and Sequoiadendron giganteum Capital.

## 🎯 Task

Your job is to **clone this repo** and add a unique feature. Some ideas are listed below.

It doesn't need to work 100% reliably, or even be completely done. It just has to:

- Show that you are creative and can iterate on novel ideas fast
- Demonstrate good system thinking and code practices
- Prove you are a capable full stack and/or LLM dev

Once you're done, we'll book a call where you'll get to present your work!

If it's cracked, we might just have to acquire Blueberry Browser to stay alive 👀👀👀

### ⏰ Time

**1-2 weeks** is ideal for this challenge. This allows you to work over weekends and during evenings in your own time.

### 📋 Rules

You are allowed to vibe code, but make sure you understand everything so we can ask technical questions.

## 💡 Feature Ideas

### **Browsing History Compiler**

Track the things that the user is doing inside the browser and figure out from a series of browser states what the user is doing, and perhaps how valuable, repetitive tasks can be re-run by an AI agent.

_Tab state series → Prompt for web agent how to reproduce the work_

### **Coding Agent**

Sidebar coding agent that can create a script that can run on the open tabs.

Maybe useful for filling forms or changing the page's style so it can extract data but present it in a nicer format.

### **Tab Completion Model**

Predict next action or what to type, like Cursor's tab completion model.

### **Your Own Idea**

Feel free to implement your own idea!

> Wanted to try transformers.js for a while? This is your chance!

> Have an old cool web agent framework you built? Let's see if you can merge it into the browser!

> Think you can add a completely new innovation to the browser concept with some insane, over-engineered React? Lfg!

Make sure you can realistically showcase a simple version of it in the timeframe. You can double check with us first if uncertain! :)

## 💬 Tips

Feel free to write to us with questions or send updates during the process—it's a good way to get a feel for working together.

It can also be a good way for us to give feedback if things are heading in the right or wrong direction.

## 🚀 Project Setup

### Install

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
$ pnpm dev
```

**Add an OpenAI API key to `.env`** in the root folder.

Strawberry will reimburse LLM costs, so go crazy! _(Please not more than a few hundred dollars though!)_

### Stagehand Agent Setup

Blueberry Browser includes a Stagehand-powered AI agent that can autonomously perform web tasks using Gemini Computer Use.

**Required Environment Variables:**

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
STAGEHAND_AGENT_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025
STAGEHAND_VERBOSE=1
STAGEHAND_CDP_PORT=9222
```

**How to Use:**

1. The browser automatically enables remote debugging on port 9222 (configurable via `STAGEHAND_CDP_PORT`)
2. Open the sidebar chat (⌘E) and toggle the "Agent" mode button
3. Type your task instruction (e.g., "Fill out this form" or "Search for flights")
4. The agent will execute the task autonomously using computer vision and browser automation

**How It Works:**

- Stagehand connects to the Electron browser via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model for visual understanding and action execution
- Automatically highlights cursor movements and actions for visibility
- Tasks run with up to 30 steps by default
